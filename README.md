## Overview

The Frankfurt Airport Runway Simulator aims to identify and analyze runway bottlenecks caused by frequent weather changes. The goal is to simulate various scenarios and provide insights into the conditions that create the worst bottlenecks, ultimately helping airport authorities optimize landing procedures.

## Project Structure

The simulator was developed in Java, a classic object-oriented programming language, ensuring compatibility between multiple operating systems in a strict corporate environment. The software implements essential object-oriented design patterns, including Observer, Singleton, and Factory patterns, to increase flexibility and scalability for future needs.
